<h3>Welcome to Raw Salmon! (1/29/2020)</h3>
<div id="post">Hey everybody! Biobeet here, i'm just gonna talk about what this blog is gonna be epicly.</div>
<div id="post">This blog is gonna be e v e r y t h i n g. I don't want it to have any specific topic or anything. Chances are, it will be school related. However, I'll probably also talk about games, outside activities, and basically just anything that applies to anyone.</div>
<div id="post">Suggestions are open if there is a certain topic you want me to talk about. Goodbye!</div>
