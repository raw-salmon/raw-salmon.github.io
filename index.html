<h3>Papa's Game Review (2/14/2020)</h3>
<div id="post">Greetings, children. For the past couple of weeks, I have gone through and played every single Papa’s Cooking game (Papa Louie Games not included) to see which games were the best. These are my results.</div>
<div id="post">Papa’s Pizzeria -  I refuse to play this game. It's the least fun, the worst setup, big stupid. It only has one playable character and the worst graphics. However, it did spark an entire line of games. 4.9/10</div>
<div id="post">Papa’s Burgeria - No creatable characters, very simple, no systems or games or anything. No upgrades to help you and the only thing you can buy is clothing. Graphics aren’t as great but are more forgivable. Money is harder to get. Has a classic cooking method that kind of wasn't great but still a classic. This game is a classic. If you can get past the flaws this is a great game. 7.25/10</div>
<div id="post">Papa’s Taco Mia - No creatable characters, a forgettable cast of characters, and less unlockables. Very similar to Papa’s Burgeria. Graphics are honestly better, and they’re almost to the graphic point of all the newer games. A few glitches, one big one was in the build section, as it would move where the toppings were going. You can get upgrades now, which are helpful.  7.5/10</div>
<div id="post">Papa’s Pancakeria - Once again, there are no creatable characters. Starting right off, you will see that there is a locked station. I don't remember playing this far in this game, so I’m left to play until level 15 to unlock it. It will get point deductions if it is not worth it. It has the same cooking method that I said I don't totally like. What’s the best part of this game? It introduced Foodini. Yes, now you get to play minigames. Are they good? Yeah, they’re fairly decent. The mystery station is a juice station. I wish there was more to it, like maybe a bacon or sausage with it. Anyways, it’s a fairly good game, and I enjoy it. 8.35/10</div>
<div id="post">Papa’s Wingeria - The first game with creatable characters! Starting off, I can already tell this might be one of my favorite games of the series. The cooking method is decent, the saucing method is more original (and a little stupid, but I can get past that), and I like the build section. The cast is somewhat more memorable and it is generally a more fun game. It has a full shop and more unlockables. How are the minigames? Halfway Decent. 9.25/10</div>
<div id="post">Papa’s Hot Doggeria - I have decided I do not like the cooking method. Sure, it’s a classic method, but it’s stupid. This form of building feels redundant now, like it was pulled straight out of Taco Mia or Burgeria. Keaton says the minigames are good in this one, and I don't want to play it to prove him right, so I believe him. This is a good and well made game, I just don't like playing it. 6.90/10</div>
<div id="post">Papa’s Pastaria - One of the best games of the series, and it might be my personal favorite at the end. It finally has a great cast of characters. Each different station is great, I can’t think of much wrong with them. I love the holidays and it was hard to play a different game after this one. 9.25/10</div>
<div id="post">Papa’s Donuteria -  I don't know about you, but I had a strong feeling that this game was not going to be good. Was I right? Sadly, yes. The “Dough” section is garbage. You get points in a really stupid way. If you cut your doughnut right in the middle of the dough ball, you get a better score. If you move it, even just a bit outward, you get less points. There’s (another) frying station, which I’m so used to it being there now that I stopped caring about it. The build station is also really stupid, because just like Cupcakeria, its hard to control. Also, the minigames are bad. 6.55/10</div>
<div id="post">Papa’s Cupcakeria - Starting right off I hate the batter method. You have to release the dispenser button EARLY but the cooldown is never exact. It is infuriating. Already off to a poopy start. The build station is also super terrible. It’s so small and loose, you can’t stay on the cupcake. Ever. There’s also a useless addition of different cups that add nothing but a “challenge”. I’m still waiting for the cast to reach its best, which I know is soon. Not an enjoyable game. 6.5/10</div>
<div id="post">Papa’s Cheeseria - Small sidenote:  hate the stock characters. This is about when I feel like the games are starting to become a little lazier. However, I kinda like this game. It isn’t perfect, but it's satisfactory. On the other hand, though, it is easy to mess up. Point deduction becomes more possible in this game, especially with tasks that are a little harder to do. This was a game that I wanted to play forth, but it was a little disappointing. Expectations aside though, I give it an 8.45/10.</div>
<div id="post">Papa’s Bakeria - Since most of the other dessert baking games left me with a sour taste in my mouth, I didn’t have high hopes for this game. However, I was pleasantly surprised to see that I actually really enjoyed it! It's a game that would make you think it would dock points for dumb things, but it was a basic enjoyable game. I actually really enjoyed all of the stations, and I think it’s a food subject I actually want to see in a game. 9.3/10</div>
<div id="post">Papa’s Sushiria - Here’s another really original Papa’s game. The cooking style is very unique, and the building station is actually fairly different from the other games. The tea station is challenging, but it doesn’t dock points for that much. Can’t deny that the game feels a little slow at times. After a very long while I realized I was spending a long time on the game and it might have been one of my favorites. The minigames are great and the cast is memorable. 9.4/10</div>
<div id="post">Papa’s Scooperia - Going into this game, I didn’t have great hopes, but I wasn't totally sure. I was sure it would feel a lot like it's old roots. I feel like I was half right. The game does feel somewhat old style, but a little more modern. This was, sadly, another bad baking game. I liked the feel and the cast and the minigames, but the full premise of the game was just not great. There’s obviously not much I have to say about this game. I’ll give it a 6.8/10.</div>
<div id="post">So, what are my ultimate thoughts? What are the best games? My top 5 Papa’s Cooking games are:</div>
<div id="post"> - Papa’s Pastaria</div>
<div id="post"> - Papa’s Sushiria</div>
